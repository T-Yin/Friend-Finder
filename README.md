# Bikini Bottom Friend Finder
A compatibility-based "Friend-Finder" application that uses express and path node packages.
The questions use a range/slider for the user's answers and compares them to each of the "friends" listed in the API. Once the user has submitted their answers, their closest match will be displayed via modal.

It is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed through this link: https://mighty-brushlands-59636.herokuapp.com/
